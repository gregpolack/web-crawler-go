# Web Crawler

## A CLI tool for generating website reports.

This is another guided project I am following courtesy of the boot.dev learning platform. It is an application designed to find all the "internal links" of a given website and generate a report based on them. The main goals of the project are to:

* Get hands-on practice with local Go development
* Practice making HTTP requests
* Learn how to parse HTML
* Practice uint testing
